      "summary": "A Malaysian vampire consisting of a detached female head with dangling organs and entrails that flies at night to feed on blood, particularly targeting pregnant women and newborns.",
      "full": "The Penanggalan is one of Southeast Asia's most horrifying supernatural creatures—a female vampire whose head detaches from her body at night, trailing her exposed spine, intestines, stomach, and other internal organs as she flies through the darkness seeking blood. By day, she appears as a normal woman, often a midwife or someone who practices black magic. At night, her head separates and flies off to feed, preferring the blood of pregnant women, newborns, and placentas. She uses her long tongue to feed. The origins vary: some say she's a woman practicing black magic, others that she's a midwife who broke fasting rules and was cursed. During the day, she must return to her body and shrink her organs by soaking them in a jar of vinegar to fit back into her body cavity. Protection includes thorny plants around the house (the thorns catch in her dangling entrails) and detection by the smell of vinegar. The Penanggalan is similar to the Filipino Manananggal and represents living folk tradition in Southeast Asia, where some belief continues today."
